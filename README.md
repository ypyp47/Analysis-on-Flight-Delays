# Analysis on Flight Delays

This analysis started from my personal experience and pure curiosity.

Last Summer, I had a trip to San Jose. When I was returning to my home, I received a notification that my flight had been delayed about 40 mins. I arrived at the airport earlier than I expected and I did not want to stay longer in the airport, so I asked an employee if I could take an earlier flight which had no delay. I successfully changed my ticket and arrived at home safely and early. Since I have an interest in the aviation industry, I often search for a flight tracker (It is especially fun to see the route! The route slightly changes every time). On that day, I also searched for the histories of the flight that I took and the original flight that I was supposed to take. I found out that the flight that I was supposed to take actually departed around 2 hours late!!

Flight delays often happen and I became curious what makes those delays. I searched, downloaded, and analyzed data to find out the main factors that cause flight delays and trends of flight delays by month, airport, and airline.
